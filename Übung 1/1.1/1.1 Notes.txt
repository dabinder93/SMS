# Count the Letter Frequency
# Searched for most common 3 letter word ("EAQ"), which has to be "THE" (most common word in english), so 
# Wrote down all 2 letter words (NI, SR, LR, SF, LO, ES, MO, CQ, ST, NQ)
# Count those words and look up the most common 2 letter words (be, to, of, in, it, on, he)
# O has to be "S" , because e.g. PSSZâ€™O has a single apostrophe.
# Because O is "S", the word "LO" has to mean "IS", -> L -> "I"
# M is the most common single letter word in the text. -> has to be "A"
# ST, SR, ST start with the same letter. most common 2 letter word with the same first letter are "IN", "IT", "IF" ,  or "OF", "ON", "OR"
# asPeYt -> aspect | Y -> c, P -> p
# esPeciaZZL -> Z -> l, L -> y
# QelatiOnal -> Relational , Q -> R , O -> o
# KataNases -> Databases, K -> d, N -> b
# at this point, the text makes sense and i just swapped the other letters. (e.g. desiWn -> design)
